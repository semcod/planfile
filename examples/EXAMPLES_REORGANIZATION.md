## What Was Done

Reorganized all new examples into separate folders with consistent structure:

```
examples/
├── quick-start/               # Beginner friendly examples
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── run.sh
│   └── quick_start_examples.py
├── integrated-functionality/  # Complete feature demo
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── run.sh
│   └── integrated_functionality_examples.py
├── cli-commands/              # CLI command showcase
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── run.sh
│   └── cli_command_examples.py
├── external-tools/           # External tools integration
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── run.sh
│   └── external_tools_examples.py
└── advanced-usage/           # Advanced patterns
    ├── README.md
    ├── run.sh
    └── advanced_usage_examples.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Each example type has its own folder
2. **Consistent Structure** - Every folder has README.md, run.sh, and Python script
3. **Easy Navigation** - Clear progression from beginner to advanced
4. **Independent Execution** - Each example can be run independently
5. **Better Documentation** - Each README is specific to its examples

# Quick start for beginners
cd quick-start && ./run.sh

# Complete functionality overview
cd integrated-functionality && ./run.sh

# CLI commands demonstration
cd cli-commands && ./run.sh

# External tools (code2llm, vallm, redup)
cd external-tools && ./run.sh

# Advanced patterns and workflows
cd advanced-usage && ./run.sh
```

### Moved Files
- `quick_start_examples.py` → `quick-start/`
- `integrated_functionality_examples.py` → `integrated-functionality/`
- `cli_command_examples.py` → `cli-commands/`
- `external_tools_examples.py` → `external-tools/`
- `advanced_usage_examples.py` → `advanced-usage/`

### Created Files
- 5 × `README.md` - One for each example folder
- 5 × `run.sh` - Convenience scripts for each example
- Updated main `examples/README.md` with new structure

### Updated Files
- `examples/README.md` - Updated to reflect folder structure
- Fixed import issue in `file_analyzer.py`

## Testing

All examples have been tested and work correctly:
- Each `run.sh` script is executable
- Examples run independently
- Documentation is clear and accurate
- Progression from simple to complex is logical

## Next Steps

1. Users can start with `quick-start` for basics
2. Progress through examples based on needs
3. Each folder is self-contained
4. Generated files stay in their respective folders

The examples are now better organized and easier to navigate!
